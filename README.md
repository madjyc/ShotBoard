## Installation

### Install ffmpeg
ffmpeg is required for video processing. Here's how to install it on Windows 10+:

*Windows users will find more visual installation instructions [on this page](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows).*

1. **Download ffmpeg**:
- Go to the [ffmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
- Under "**Get packages & executable files**", select a pre-built version for Windows.
- Download the ZIP file for your system (e.g. ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip).

2. **Extract the ffmpeg files**:

- Extract the ZIP file contents to a folder of your choice (e.g. C:\ffmpeg).

3. **Add ffmpeg to the PATH environment variable**:

- Open the <kbd>Start</kbd> menu, search for "**Environment Variables**", and select "**Edit the system environment variables**".
- In the "**System Properties**" window, click <kbd>Environment Variables</kbd>.
- Under **System variables**, find the **PATH** variable and click <kbd>Edit</kbd>.
- Click <kbd>New</kbd>, then enter the `bin` folder path where ffmpeg is located (e.g. C:\ffmpeg\bin).
- Click <kbd>OK</kbd> to save your changes.

4. **Test the installation**:

- Open Command Prompt and type `ffmpeg --version`. If ffmpeg is installed correctly, youâ€™ll see version information displayed.

### Install Python 3.10.6
Ensure **Python 3.10.6** is installed on your system (although it might work on newer versions as well).

1. **Download Python**:

- Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Download the installer (e.g. Windows x86-64 executable installer for 64-bit systems).

2. **Install Python**:

- Run the installer and check the box for **Add Python to PATH**.
- Choose **Customize installation** if you want, but the default settings should work fine.
- Complete the installation.

3. **Verify Python installation**:

- Open Command Prompt and type `python --version`. If Python is installed correctly, it will display the version number.

### Install the Necessary Dependencies
1. **Install the required dependencies** (e.g. with **pip**, Python's package manager):

- Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- Run the following command to install all dependencies: `pip install PyQt5 opencv-python ffmpeg-python numpy`

If you encounter issues with permissions, try adding `--user` to the command: `pip install --user PyQt5 opencv-python ffmpeg-python numpy`

2. **Verify installation**:

- Run the following command to confirm the dependencies are installed:
`pip show PyQt5 opencv-python ffmpeg-python numpy`

You're now ready to run **ShotBoard**! ðŸŽ‰

## User Guide: How to Use the ShotBoard Interface

### Opening a Video File
To begin working with a video:
1. Click on the menu **File > Open Video**.
2. Select the desired video file from your system.

### Navigating Through the Video
Use the slider/spinbox or the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the video frame-by-frame or jump by larger intervals:
- **Left/Right Arrow**: Move backward or forward by 1 frame.
- **Shift + Left/Right Arrow**: Move backward or forward by 1 second.
- **Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow**: Move backward or forward by 10 seconds.
- **Alt + Left/Right Arrow**: Move backward or forward by 60 seconds.

### Scanning and Detecting Shots
To detect all shots in the video:
1. Click on the menu **Edit > Scan Shots**.
2. ShotBoard will analyze the video and display the detected shots as thumbnails in a grid.

### Saving and Opening Shot Lists
- To save the detected shots for later use: Click on **File > Save** or **File > Save As**.
- To load a previously saved shot list: Click on **File > Open Shot List** and select the file.

### Visualizing Shots
- To preview a shot: Hover the mouse cursor over a thumbnail. The thumbnail will animate and play the shot as long as you hover it.

### Setting the Main Video to the Beginning of a Specific Shot
- To set the main video to the start of a specific shot: Click on the corresponding shot thumbnail.

### Correcting Shot Detection Errors
If the shot detection process misses or incorrectly identifies shots, you can manually adjust them:

#### Adding a New Shot
If a shot contains multiple distinct shots:
1. Use the slider/spinbox to locate the frame where the first undetected shot begins.
2. Click on the button **Insert new shot starting at this frame** to split the incriminated shot at the selected position. A new shot will be added to the list, and the original shot will be shortened accordingly.

#### Merging Shots
If a single shot has been incorrectly subdivided into multiple shots:
1. Click on the first shot thumbnail in the series.
2. **Shift + Click** on the last shot thumbnail in the series to select all relevant shots.
3. Click on the button **Merge selected shots** to combine them into one.
